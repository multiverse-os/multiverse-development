# Router provisioning/configuration


* add using periodic & local id to galaxy + universe router scritps

* *support parsing XML from libvirt & TOML from Xen to Multiverse YAML VM configuration format that will be used by portalgun*

* Q35 can solve same GPU passthrough issues. Q35 is newer, should be the default, and probably should be the only option by having legacy emulators ripped out to make Qemu lgither weight, easier to maintain and  asfster.
