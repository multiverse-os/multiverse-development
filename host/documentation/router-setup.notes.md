# Router provisioning/configuration
Router provisioning & configuration: 

    * Add using periodic & local id to (bridge 0 & 1) routers script

    * *Support parsing XML from libvirt & TOML from Xen to Multiverse YAML VM configuration format that will be used by Portalgun*

    * Q35 can solve same GPU passthrough issues *Q35 is newer, should be the default, and probably should be the only option by having legacy emulators ripped out to make Qemu lgither weight, easier to maintain and  faster.*
