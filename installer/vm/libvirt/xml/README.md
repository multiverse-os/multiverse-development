# Multiverse OS Controllers
The controllers that will be included in the alpha release:

	* **Debian** default

	* **Ubuntu** alternative default 

	* **Ubuntu+Steam** for gamming system that is setup to immediately game
		* Eventually store checksum of games after downloaded so they can be easily stored safely and most of the machine can be ephemeral, just dropping in the games after booting. 

	* **OSX** to provide system for graphics designers, film editing, and other creative software. Can be primary controller but its not the devlopers primary system and does not get priority.
