# Shell Scripts
A collection of shell scripts written sometimes using the included `sh` framework to provide functionality required during the development of Multiverse OS (at least during this early pre-alpha development cycle).

This will help guide development of the alpha release, in addition, be standardized and included as is, in shell script form, compiled into the shell framework, and released as an alteranative to the Go replacements in case they turn out to be useful at a later date. 

Only until after we can guarnatee we we wil not require them, as in when we switch our base shell framework from `sh` to our more expressive solution yet to be completed but in active development under the `multish` project that provides an interface to interact with the entire cluster or all combinations of VMs that make up the cluster.
