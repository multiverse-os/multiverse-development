# CLI Installer
The CLI installater will be based on the CLI framework library that has been under active development for a while, in combination with the recently discovered TUI frameowrk and survey library to take in user input. 

This CLI installer will be the basis for installation, take in configurations to support automated or unattended installation. A preseed file to takae answers all beforehand in a file. And support taking a ssh client connection by using a built in SSH server that enables a simplified network installation. 

These will then be simply wrapped to provide the GUI installer, which will be packaged with the default installation media, and so primarily used installer. By building it on a solid and feature complete foundation, time can be invested in the various details because this will be the installer used in the first release candidate too.
