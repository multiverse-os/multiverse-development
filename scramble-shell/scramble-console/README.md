# Multiverse Consoles
Segregating activities via nesting consoles that abstract a high level interface over existing applications/services so a command like

````
media music play (music name) (room or speakers)
````

will start playing music with the default (or configuration) defined music player. Support for merging all computers, speakers, and so on. From this interface software can be easily built and link various input data around an entire building or room can be easily programmed against data from the internet and data or use outputs in a given room or building.
