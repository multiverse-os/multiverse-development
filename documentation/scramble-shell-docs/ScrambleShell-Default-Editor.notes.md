Gedit is a nice C based easy to use editor. It is quite full 
featured, and could be a good default editor.
  

gedit uses a Multiple Document Interface (MDI), which lets you edit more than 
one document at the same time.

Although new features are always under development, currently gedit has:

    * Complete support for UTF-8 text
    * Syntax highlighting
    * Support for editing remote files
    * Search and replace
    * Printing and Print Previewing Support
    * File Revert
    * A complete preferences interface
    * Configurable Plugin system, with optional python support
