##  ScrambleShell: File Manager
##
=================================================================
Nautilius is really bad, its built in Python, its hard to extend
its unstable, its slow, **it doesnt live update** and doesn't
support features that SHOULD BE DEFAULT BY NOW:
**Features**
  * Per folder and Per File encryption
    *Support encryption to multiple keys, individually so they*
    *can decrypt separetely or together so it requires BOTH*
    *parties to decrypt*
    
  * Live updating UI
    *If files change, if names change, in another place, they*
    *should be updating in the UI*
    
  * Accompanying WebUI
  	*Built in WebUI (we will be using a *Web Rendering Engine*
  	*with Javascript disabled entirely) so this should provide*
  	*remote access in a way that is seamless and feels like using*
  	*it locally.*
  	
  * Automated Column Matching
  	*Automatically match columns to the file types, if one is*
  	*navigating music files, columns to reflect this and provide*
  	*track length, BPM, maybe a spectrum*
  	
  * Right click Web File Sharing
  	Right click, Share > Web > Endpoint
  	
  *

## Nautilus - 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Nautilus is not entirely written in Python, it is written in C 
and leverages Python and Javascript for different aspects of it. 
Multiverse is moving away from this towards a mixture of Rust,
Go and Ruby.
