##  ScrambleShell: Cryptography Tools
##
=================================================================
*One of the biggest hurdles in the last 5 to 10 years is how*
*difficult cryptography is to use;* this is what has prevented
the average computer user to protect themselves from mass
survellience, to support local small-scale e-commerce, and to
build a wide variety of decentralized identity systems.

## Keys & Password & Accounts UI
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The core visible component the user will see when interacting
with what is referred to now as the scramble suit identity 
protocol will be essetentially an advanced and pretty version
of the software `pass`. It appears Gnome developers are also
looking at this, so it may be worth investigating.

gnome-keyring
gnome-keyring is a program that keep password and other secrets for
users. It is run as a daemon in the session, similar to ssh-agent, and
other applications locate it via an environment variable or a D-Bus.

The program can manage several keyrings, each with its own master
password, and there is also a session keyring which is never stored to
disk, but forgotten when the session ends.
