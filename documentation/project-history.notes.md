# Multiverse OS History
Design and development for for Multiverse OS began in late 2016, it was manually implemented on an Intel desktop computer and actively used as the primary operating system of the developer. During this period constant refinement, tuning, structuring and restructuring occured. Overtime the different major components were identified and designed individually.

Many manual installations later of Multiverse OS, and in the beginning of 2018 the final manual installation guide is being constructed from the notes of 5+ manual installations. The final manual installation guide will serve as the blueprint for the alpha Multiverse OS installer, both the first public release of the manual install guide and installer.
