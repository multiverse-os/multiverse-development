# Multiverse OS: Docs, OS Text, and Translations
Multiverse OS is designed to be a community driven project, from the beginning designed to be international project where privacy, security, open-source loving users, can collaborate to build an operating system that is capable of surviving the growing dangers of the modern internet, and is not so pretentious that we would forget to make it easy to play modern video games, and torrent the last TV show.

  [*] Build a system to store the docs in a eays to access wiki like system. Allow community members to submit articles. Do line edits, and questions. 

  [*] BUILT IN Q/A system that will be moderated, no more top answer being "just chmod 777 ~/" or "run it as root". Instead we will cultivate a community of moderates and ensure that even old answers (or the library of our knowldge) are currated, cleaned up, turned into articles, corrected and updated.

 [*] BUILT IN community driven translations of UI and documentation
