# CCID and Multiverse OS and Scramble ID Suite
**Start by getting someone in the cirlce to hel, start recuriting people to the circle**

Since CCID/Sim cards are essentially USB, does that mean we can easily rewrite the data? Can we just virtualize the SIM? If so, cna we make a flexible sim card with much more space. 

To help promote Multiverse OS, we should get at lest 1,000. We can give away 50-100 and sell the rest.

## Peer-to-peer point of sale/ payment gateway
We should build special software that allows any phone to accept them as a peer-to-peer POS system wihtout the need for  a thir party payment gatewaym or the likes. Athough we should see if we could add some soft of peer based point of sale gateway (As in, you make a purchase, by putting some coin in a contract that gets relesaed to the firs tperson who provides a visa payment to the person

We also started to design special usb drives that do not utilize a microcontorller to make them

## Maybe using these CCID we could design a sim card type system for VOIP phones too?



Regardless a write up could do a write up for both crowd supply and kickstarter; that regardless if they fail, they could at least promote and provide us with e aoslid write up to use for the alpha release website and initial documentaitpn

### Potential awards:
## IN addititon to offering CCID, could offer Tshfits with the logo, could offer, early alpha release

## Offer feature request that will be honored within the the next major update or next three minor (whatever comes first)

## Could offer custom keyboard that holds key or usb slot for the key
