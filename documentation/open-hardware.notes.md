# Open Source Liberty And Technology For Everyone
Multiverse personal computers or the operating system without specialized open source hardware has the primary goal of providing open access to open source solutions that power just about everything. An attempt to create a future that does not require hacking ourselves to have basic access to our technology that often is purchased at subscription like regularity, based on developed and cultivated practice leading governments, universities and people around the world purchasing and repurchasing a ord processor, spreadsheet software, and a user-friendly tool for creating standardized and specialized websites used for presentations. Year after year, as if there were major and critical changes and innovation between releases; and any critical analysis would reveal that pay


Anyone can learn how to build open source robots, and development of Multiverse OS and the open source hardware that is designed to enhance the user experience. Multiverse OS is intended to be the operating system for a collection of "personal computers" and Servers including home servers and rack servers. The primary use case for Multiverse is end-user or personal computing, our primary goal is to provide three (3) types of open source computers: divided further into two (2) mobile computers, (a) a handheld model or "phone" size, (b) a document or "tablet" size, roughly A4, and either will work with the modular addons that "converts" it to our laptop model. Our designs are meant to be maximually efficient, lower our production and design costs and modular design enables it to be used for a variety of other solutions like a 'proof-of-sale' system or inventory management terminal. The case is specifically is designed to be switched easily to provide different levels of water, heat, drop and other hazards while using the same core design and technology. This also allows it to be easily converted to a portal game terminal, and its open source design allows for many other specific use cases by other organizations or projects, or poeple to solve problems, create products or just play some games. 


## A personal computer with Multiversal compatibility
Multiverse OS is an open source Linux based operating system designed to standardize, simplify, and most importantly provide open source security features used to secure transnationals, economies, and important internets. Multiverse OS is designed to fill a gap in technology: modern secure personal computing. Using features and technologies that are almost exclusively the domain of servers in massive datacenters, in combination with a large mixture of unique implementation or invention. 

The goal is to create a secure and open personal computer. 








A simple statement, but a complex task. Our plan requires first the creation of a community; that process is started, and the development of an operating system has been ongoing design, and implementation for four (4) years. That community will formilize and standardize the process, maintain resources, provide fair compensation for workers, automate the boardroom. 


The community will form an autonmous workers cooperative, focused around the novel, and somehow  always overlooked solution of automation of it's board of executives; before the factory floor.

A surprisingly easy task, since the board of directors is made up of easily automatable positions, taking the highest salaries. According to the Economic Policy Institute [FOOTNOTE:Economic Policy Institute](a US-- D.C. non-profit "non-partisan" think-tank, Founded by a group which includes Robert Reich former Sectretary of Labor 1993-1997, creator of remarkably centrist and unironic "Saving Capitalism" in combination with "Inequality for All", so in the US likely receives the "neo-liberal" or centrist label, and globally would rank right leaning.),   before the creatives, and before the engineers), a workers cooperative, an

 hardware in essence provides a hardware implementation core functionality of the operating system software, which translates to being highly simplified standardization open and modifiable; highly mesh-networkable to link all electronics, beyond netwrok cables, using software defined mesh networking (using software defined network controllers): an example is software-defined IR network controller, so capable of controlling 80's and 90's technologies, and further to mechanical technology anywhere, a house, a park, above and below earth's surface. By itself its massively networkable, and securely interfaces and proxies a connection to the internet. 










Multiverse OS computers sold by the Multiverse foundation will include three (3) "multiiversal interface" base units- functioning as both use case examples and matching standard auxillary devices typically included, and so these typically single-use auxillary devices will demonstrate how using open extensible, repariable, upgradable hardware can still exist; and match small design, furthermore customizable or personalized form-factors associated with traditionally closed but popular brands like Macintosh (Apple Macs if you are British) computers.


 simple mehcanical technology to make smart ojbects stupid (just propreitary single use insecure computers crippled with closed-source software to limit the usage, interaction and control), and absolutely most importantly: highly secure: implementing hardware comparmentalization (which is obviously faster than containers and more secure than Virtual Machines), which also enables "super-computer" style parallel computing design. However, it is more than just implementing the core software design in hardware, because, at least a quarter of the open source hardware provides unique functionality or unique security enhancement that is virtualized and prototyped in our software but the hardware implementations inherently are more secure.)





The importance of modularity in design (both hardware and software) is just below security in importance and priority; all our computer (and interface) designs are meant to be buildable diy style, by any organization (whom may be extending, improving, or specializing the default feature set); a real return to universal and open architecture. And very importantly the modularity should focus initially on providing complete unviersal backwards compatibility to intergrate existing systems into a mesh network through hardware and software with truly unparallled security, solving massively insecure "smart" devices that wall off their technology to the point of fundamentally breaking the internet, and require people to hack themselves to obtain basic control over hardware they own; that can feature updates that intentionally slow them down, or the regular practice of using open source software to simplify disabling functionality, acces and control to generate requirement for increasing number of products and eventual waste.
















##### What if a law is just a statistical anamoly?
A fact intionally obsutfuciated and little talked about due to manfuracturing interests: Moore's law has broken down, and it occured nearly a decade ago. A decade that required apple to install updates on devices to slow them down so that there would be a noticable difference between the old and new releases of their hardware. 

Several years of new hardware, features updates in software, and importantly because not just the amount and toxicity of the waste, but the rarity driving conflicts (wars, genocides, and slavery) in both the mining but also the manufacturing of many components make these purely greedy, myopic and destructive. 

This distrubting global and legal act of destruction filling landfills with hardware marginly improved, with a recent focus on novelty to obstuficate the breakdown of Moore's law is truly and pracitcally a cult-like religiousity-- faith-like devotion to purchase each new design after waiting in lines to mostly to partake in whath is marketed was the marching forward in technology.

Driven by their contributions, to heroes like Steve Jobs, who they attribute invention, but is actually an obvious and following existing trends of mobile personal computers.

### Convert Voltages Up/Down 


#### Linear Regulators & Buck Converters













A __buck converter__ [High Voltage Solution][High->Low]is used to step *HIGH* voltages __DOWN__ to *LOW* voltages which handles the problem of preventing excess electrons building up in your circuit which can lead to fires or overheating. 



The __buck converter__ is basically a circuit configuration, so it can be implemented with a vareity of differnet supplies to suit your buck converter for the specific application, voltage, and other variables.

When doing research on the topic moving between currents I discovered a lot of complexity. The last time I researched this I learned about **Switch Mode Power Supplies** or **Linear Regulator**, which is the common solution for *LOW POWER* solution, but it is not typically energy efficient and can light on fire if used for high voltage solutions.

    .  .--------------------.
>  / \ | Precaution: Fires  |

> There are major differences between solutions for *LOW* and *HIGH* power solutions, and this can not be ignored because it can lead to a build of electrons which translates to a build up of heat and can lead to fires. 





 In technical terms, we need _a closed loop control scheme with negative feedback_, this translates to the following pieces: 

	* **Perfboard** which is the type of breadboard that is on a PC or custom PCBs are required, you do not use breadboard for high power prototyping. They can be identical to breadboard design to simple grids of perfiations which different connection patterns. 
	* A _capacitor_ for the _vin_
	* A _ceramic (high heat tolerance, like for 8-30V we will want a 50V rating on our capacitor) capacitor_ for


Example: 10v is on a cirtuit, and we want to add a switch to turn something on and off (where we would use a transistor *(Software analogy: an if statement exclusively type classed to boolean)*, and mosfet *(Software analogy: an if statemetn that works with boolean or uint values)*.

So in summary: 




The topic of 'non-isolated _DC_ power supplies' includes within it units of circuitry (Software analogy: A function), covers stepping up and down in voltages, for both high and low votages. There are two major classes or what we will call "voltage converters" *(The authors lack of formal education and lack of knowledge on traditional naming in regards to electrical engineering, my background is software engineering and Biology, primarily Biochemistry and Genetics)* 

	* __High Power Solutions__
		* _Stepping *Up In* Voltage_
		* _Stepping *Down* in Voltage_
			* _Buck Converter_ 
	* __Low Power Solutions__
		* _Stepping *Up In* Voltage_
		* _Stepping *Down* in Voltage_
			* _Linear Regulator_ used for low power solutions, like 3.3v, which is common usecase for open source hardware hackers, and Multiverse OS developers. Traditionally, or at least relationally these use more power than buck converters, and can build up heat. 
	(Keep in mind that linear regulators are sources of heat in your design this will be important)

	(Radio receivers and similar technology will require high quality linear regulators, because the sensitivity of to magnetic fields affects quality since this is exactly what we are measuring. So this also applies to multi-dimensional mangnemeters.  

 the eventual idea is to have a collection of desired chips, and using evolution-type machine learning to automatically
