[cleanflight github](https://github.com/cleanflight/cleanflight)
    If you're looking for experimental new features and don't mind doing your homework, checkout the betaflight fork.
    If you're looking for advanced navigation features then check out the iNav fork.
    All other users should use Cleanflight.
Features:
		Awesome flight performance as trusted by the majority of Acrobatic and Racing Drone pilots.
		Support for modern STM32 based processors F1/F3/F4/F7.
		Support for modern accelerometer/gyro/barometer/compass sensors.
		Support for modern ESC technologies DSHOT/ONESHOT and legacy PWM.
		Support for Multi-color RGB LED strip support.
		Advanced on-board telemetry logging (Blackbox).
		Wide support of receivers (SBus/iBus/SumD/SumH/PPM/PWM/CRSF/JetiExBus)
		Wide support of telemetry protocols (FrSky/SmartPort/S.Port/HoTT/iBus/LTM/MavLink/CRSF/SRXL).
		Built-in OSD support & configuration without needing third-party OSD software/firmware/comm devices.
		Support for external OSD slave systems.
		VTX support (RTC6705/Unify Pro(SmartAudio)/IRC Tramp/etc).
		and MUCH, MUCH more.

### AVR
https://github.com/rweather/arduinolibs
This distribution contains a bunch of libraries and example applications that I have made for Arduino, covering a variety of tasks from blinking LED's to LCD's and RTC-based alarm clocks. They are distributed under the terms of the MIT license.

### PIC [http://hyvatti.iki.fi/%7Ejaakko/pic/picprog.html]
https://github.com/rweather/ardpicprog
This distribution contains an Arduino-based solution for programming PIC microcontrollers from Microchip Technology Inc, such as the PIC16F628A and friends.

 PICmicro microcontrollers, or MCUs, are fine chips that are especially easy to program with a simple device attached to a parallel or serial port. Because of the EEPROM or Flash memory, they are also easy and fast to erase and reprogram without need for UV equipment. This makes them very popular among electronics hobbyists.

At the moment this is the second implementation of a PIC programmer for Linux that works with the very simple and cheap serial port programmers. The first one I know was made by Ralph Metzler in 1996. My programmer was originally designed for PIC16C84 and PIC16F84 chips back in 1997, and since then I have implemented other chips without access to most of them. I have tested PIC16F628, PIC16F676, PIC12F675, PIC16F88, PIC16F876A, PIC16F76, PIC18F1320 and PIC18F458. Others have used many other models. The dsPIC30 family has some code in the sources, but the support is not finished yet. Some 12 bit chips should be supported but I have not tested that support.
