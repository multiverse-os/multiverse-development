//! A module for interpreting byte slices as protocol data units (PDUs).

//! A PDU represents data transmitted as a single unit during communication using a specific
//! protocol. Ethernet frames, IP packets, and TCP segments are all examples of protocol data
//! units.

/// This is the baseline definition of the `Incomplete` struct, which wraps a PDU that does is
/// still missing some values or content.
///
/// It's mostly important when writing PDUs, because fields like checksum
/// can only be computed after the payload becomes known. Also, the length of the underlying slice
/// should be equal to the actual size for a complete PDU. To that end, whenever a variable-length
/// payload is involved, the slice is shrunk to an exact fit. The particular ways of completing an
/// `Incomplete<T>` are implemented for each specific PDU.
