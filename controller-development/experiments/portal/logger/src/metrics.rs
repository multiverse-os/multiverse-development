//! Defines the metrics system.
//!
//! # Design
//! The main design goals of this system are:
//! * Use lockless operations, preferably ones that don't require anything other than
//!   simple reads/writes being atomic.
//! * Exploit interior mutability and atomics being Sync to allow all methods (including the ones
//!   which are effectively mutable) to be callable on a global non-mut static.
//! * Rely on `serde` to provide the actual serialization for logging the metrics.
//! * Since all metrics start at 0, we implement the `Default` trait via derive for all of them,
//!   to avoid having to initialize everything by hand.
//!
//! Moreover, the value of a metric is currently NOT reset to 0 each time it's being logged. The
//! current approach is to store two values (current and previous) and compute the delta between
//! them each time we do a flush (i.e by serialization). There are a number of advantages
//! to this approach, including:
//! * We don't have to introduce an additional write (to reset the value) from the thread which
//!   does to actual logging, so less synchronization effort is required.
//! * We don't have to worry at all that much about losing some data if logging fails for a while
//!   (this could be a concern, I guess).
//! If if turns out this approach is not really what we want, it's pretty easy to resort to
//! something else, while working behind the same interface.
