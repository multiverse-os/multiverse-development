# Multiverse OS: Application Portals
Application and Service Portals (VMs) are special type of VMs that contain and isolate two types of software. Applicaiton Portals pass a window or several windows from the Application VM and render directly on the User Interface Controller Portal.

In contract, Service Portals are specialized VMs that are designed specifically to run a very specific set of processes, allowing no additional processes and locking down the entire system making it essentially impossible for anything else to be ran.
