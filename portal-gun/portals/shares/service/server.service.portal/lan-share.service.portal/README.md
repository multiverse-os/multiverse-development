# Voyager File Sharing Service VM
The **Voyager File-sharing VM** is a **Service VM** that provides both LAN file-sharing and WAN file sharing (specifically torrenting for now). 

The Voyager VM can be connected to either the Universe network to share files with LAN computers or put within the Galaxy network to transparently proxy all torrent traffic over a VPN. 

#### Development

  * Mount media files and share them via NFS or other network sharing that is not SAMBA

  * Setup  

#### Feature Brainstorming
Below are a list of potential features that can be implemented to improve and extend the functionality of the Controller VM.

  * Host file management that simplifies Ad blocking at the router level

  * LAN media player and streaming services to simplify watching, or listening to shared media
