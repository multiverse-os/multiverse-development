# Multiverse OS 'base-files'
The `base-files` provide all the customizations made to the filesystem in order to setup/provision a vanilla debian9 install into a `network.controller` portal.

*Currently we are not saving permissions on files, but this data needs to be saved, either separately, perhaps with a DB that contains files locations, line numbers, and permissions of the file.*
