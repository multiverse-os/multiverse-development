This directory should contain programs or scripts which are to be run
when the local service is started or stopped.

If a file in this directory is executable and it has a .start extension,
it will be run when the local service is started. If a file is
executable and it has a .stop extension, it will be run when the local
service is stopped.

All files are processed in lexical order.

Keep in mind that files in this directory are processed sequentially,
and the local service is not considered started or stopped until
everything is processed, so if you have a process which takes a long
time to run, it can delay your boot or shutdown processing.
