## Dev Notes


**Providing a "dev mode" for early development**
To build out a "dev mode" for speeding up development of Multiverse OS machines from host to controllers. It may be best to build a version of the provision scripts (preferably turned on with a switch in the script) that links the files from the `/var/multiverse/(controller|host) so that changed files are concentrated into a single location, its clear what files ahve had changes introduced and so that edits can be made in a central location and easily pushed to the git repository.
